**General format of the test**

Of course, the main language of the test is English \:D

In terms of content, this test is modeled after the actual IELTS Listening test.
Please refer to online resources to learn more about the format and content of each part of the IELTS Listening test.
Note: Review 10 examples for the corresponding part as requested to gain a basic understanding of the question types and format.

This test is provided in markdown text format and uses a script as a substitute for the audio parts.
The test is in a fixed format so that it can be directly converted into a quiz on the Canvas LMS platform.
Specifically, that format is explained in detail here: [https://github.com/gpoore/text2qti/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/gpoore/text2qti/blob/master/README.md)

The test may be divided into multiple sections with different question types, temporarily called subtasks. Each subtask corresponds to a continuous script segment.

Before each subtask begins, there will be a short introduction by the announcer explaining the task, question type, and how to fill in the answers (e.g.: ‘answers consist of one word and/or a number’).
You can refer to the introductory format in the examples you find.

The test must consist of exactly **10 questions** and should represent a full Part of a standard IELTS Listening test. The questions must be numbered from 1 to 10.

Questions appear in various formats, and within each type, they may vary — refer to the content below.
Generally, the possible question types are as follows:

### **Sentence Completion**

* **Description**: Fill in the missing information in the blanks.
* **Question format in text/script**: "Multiple-answers questions use \[] or \[ ] for incorrect answers and \[\*] for correct answers.";
  In the text, the test must specify all acceptable answers, including variations in writing (e.g., if the answer is "January 1", then "January 1", "1st January" must all be accepted).
  This ensures the recognition of different ways of writing the correct answer (capitalization, alternative wording).

### **Information Matching**

* **Description**: There are several statements and a set of tags that can be assigned to them; for each statement, select the single appropriate tag.
  A simple example is matching True/False/Not given to statements or assigning each student a task in a group.
* **Question format in text/script**: Tags are labeled in some way, typically A, B, C, etc.;
  The format also uses multiple correct answers like Sentence Completion, but acceptable answers are limited to the correct label (case-insensitive).

### **Multiple Choice Question**

* **Description**: Each question has several options, usually 3 or 4 (ABC, ABCD); candidates must choose the correct one.
* **Question format in text/script**: Refer to the text2qti format linked above.

### **Label a Map**

* **Description**: The test provides an image of an unlabeled map (with areas numbered/lettered but unnamed); candidates must fill in the labels based on the dialogue.
* **Question format in text/script**:

  * To handle images in the above format:

  ```
  Images are included with the standard Markdown syntax:

  ![alt_text](image_file)
  ```

  It is recommended that the author uploads images via an HTTP link, e.g., by uploading to a publicly accessible drive folder.

  * You should access the HTTP link, view the image (with the map), and assess the task.
  * How to check: "Multiple-answers questions use \[] or \[ ] for incorrect answers and \[\*] for correct answers.";

### **Label a Diagram**

* **Description**: The test provides an image of a diagram with missing information. These parts are labeled (with question numbers); candidates use information from the dialogue, combined with reasoning, to fill in the blanks.
* **Question format**: Similar to map labeling.

### **Criteria for Grading the Test**

You must grade the test honestly, objectively, and ruthlessly based on the following criteria:

---

### **Format Accuracy**

* **Description**: Check for correct spelling, format (compared to standard tests in examples, to the format importable to Canvas per the GitHub link above, and the descriptions above).
  Also, assess the completeness and correctness of provided answers and assign a score on a scale of \[0, 20].
  Note: Carefully analyze the provided dialogue to evaluate the accuracy of the answers — this is critical.
  A test with complete, accurate answers, clear, grammatically correct, and formatted properly per the GitHub guide should score around 19.
* **Note**: Since the test uses script instead of audio, you should not consider the inclusion of the script as not conforming to actual IELTS Listening tests format. However, the misplacement of the script or the introductions should be counted as errors.
* **Relative weight**: 0.4
* **Common errors**: Incorrect number of questions, missing/wrong answers, incorrect text2qti format.
* **Advanced errors**: Are the test and questions clear and coherent (with strict evidence extractable from the dialogue)?

---

### **Question Type Accuracy**

* **Description**: Cross-reference with the descriptions of question types and part characteristics and assess alignment on a scale of \[0, 20].
  A test closely resembling the sample tests would score around 18.
* **Relative weight**: 1
* **Common errors**: Not matching the descriptions above, e.g., requiring 2 subtasks but only having one, or including an inappropriate question type.
* **Advanced errors**: Is the test content appropriate as described, and does it align with examples found for that part?

---

### **Challenge Level**

* **Description**: Refer to the challenges described for each part and your own assessment of the test’s difficulty (is it tricky, deceptive, requiring multiple thinking steps, or advanced vocabulary?) and rate it on a scale of \[0, 20].
  A test matching the difficulty of sample tests would score around 18.
  Note that in actual tests, the relative difficulty of each part is 50-60-70-70 on a scale of 0-100 for parts 1-2-3-4.
* **Scoring method**
* **Relative weight**: 0.6
* **Error checking**: Refer to the challenge section for each part above. Also, use your own judgment to assess the test's trickiness.

---

For each criterion, grade according to the description, then multiply by the relative weight.

The **final score** is the sum of all components (sum of (score per criterion) \* (scaling factor)).
Note that the final score will fall within \[0, 40]. You must **scale this to \[0, 100]** when reporting. In order to accomplish that, it is enough to just multiply the score in [0, 40] with a constant factor of 2.5.

Report your comments and thoughts while grading according to the mentioned criterions.

At the end, you must report **a single final quality score of the test** calculated by the formula above. Note that this must be at the end of the report.
Report it in this format: "### **Overall quality score:** X/100" with X as the score you calculated.
After this line there should be no further comments. Give all your thoughts ABOVE this ending report line.
